# Business Admin Web Application for Kinashe Coupon Service

This is a web application designed in ReactJS for Kinashe, a startup coupon service based in Ethiopia.
It provides an interface for uploading coupons and promotions to Firebase's realtime database, which
are in turn rendered in the Kinashe mobile app. There are also interfaces for uploading and removing
company photos, creating pop up advertisements in the app, and requesting a payment plan that, once
verified, gives that company's coupons priority in the mobile app.
